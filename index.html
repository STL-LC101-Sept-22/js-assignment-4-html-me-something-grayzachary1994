            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My wife and I got married on September 8th, 2018. She was currently in her last year of college, and I
               was working full time. We didn't have much time for a honeymoon, so we took a weekend trip and planned
               our honeymoon for March of 2019 in Japan.</p>

            <h2>Day 0 - Travel</h2>
            <p>Getting to Tokyo, Japan takes about 16-24 hours depending on layovers from
               the St. Louis Airport, including layovers. Vanessa (my wife) and I left around 5A.M. on March 16, 2019.
               We finally landed in Narita Airport outside of Tokyo at 2:00 JST on March 17th.
               From the Narita Airport, we took an hour and a half train ride to our hotel in Shinjuku, Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>Being jetlagged, and exhausted from our travel, we got some small food from a convienence store and then
               spent the rest of the day in our hotel.

            <h2>Day 1 - Shinjuku</h2>
            <p>On our first day, we decided to keep it pretty relaxed and explored the area around us. We started out at
               a bakery called
               <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NSAPEw4dFXmdyCMW7">Little Bakery on 3-Chome.</a>
               We then decided to just walk around Shinjuku for a few hours, stopping at a few coin operated arcades and
               shopping malls throughout the day. Shinjuku is a major part of the city, and is home to a few massive
               shopping complexes. Just going through one took us over an hour.

            <h2>Day 2 - Shibuya &amp; Date</h2>
            <p>On our second full day, we started out by going to 711 to get some coffee, and going to
               <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UmXVdZ91AyMmDsoc6">Shinjuku Goyen National Garden</a>.
               Even though it was located in the middle of city, the garden itself was extremely quiet and felt like it
               was detatched from the city life around it.
            </p>
            <p>After we left the garden, we decided to head to one of the malls we had previously went to the day
               before, and stopped at an Original Pancake House for some fluffy pancakes. Once we finished our pancakes,
               we hopped on the subway towards Shibuya, another major section of Tokyo.
               Our first stop here was the Disney store, followed by some more shopping in giant malls. </p>
            <p>Once we finished shopping, I had a surprise rerservation planned for Vannesa at a high-end steakhouse called
               <a href="https://kobebeef511.jp/en/">Kobe Beef Kaiseki 511.</a> It definitely maxed out our budget, but
               it was an unforgettable food experience.

            <h2>Day 3 - Mount Fuji &amp; Bars</h2>
            <p>We knew during out trip that we wanted to go see Mt. Fuji, but did not have any set plans. Well, I woke up on Day 3 and decided that I wanted to immediately go see Mt. Fuji.
               It took about 3 hours of train rides, but we finally made it there. As I am looking at these pictures again, they do not come close to doing it justice. Fuji stands high above everything else, and is much larger than I had thought.
               After a few hours of exploring the town nearby, and getting our first bowl of ramen for the trip, we took another 3 hour train ride back to Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>immediately after we got back to Shinjuku, we went to a well known tourist attraction called "Golden Gai." It is over 200 bars, packed into a square block. We had a few drinks with some other tourists, and then at 3A.M. we got some KFC, called it a night. </p>

            <h2>Day 4 - Asakusa</h2>
            <p>Day 4 started out a bit rocky, with finding out I had some work I had to do remotely with my laptop. We headed to a nearby cafe that had wifi, and I worked for a few hours. As soon as we left, we headed towards
               Asakusa in Tokyo, to see one of the more popular temples. We walked down the road leading up to it, trying different street foods along the way.

            <h2>Day 5 - Odaiba</h2>
            <p>On our fifth and final day in Tokyo, we decided to go explore a small island off of mainland Tokyo called Odaiba. It is the only ocean front area within Tokyo, and is home to the famous Rainbow Bridge. 
            </p>
            <p> We spent a few hours shopping around the few malls on Odaiba, hunted on the beech for shells, and rode the massive Ferris Wheel called Daikanransha.</p>
